#summary Example: How to modify web service to support REST

We're using Calculator service from ExampleCalculatorServiceWindows or ExampleCalculatorServiceLinux.

== 1. Enabling REST support in service ==

Enabling REST support for service is very easy.
You just need to describe REST method and REST location by write special codegen metacomments:

{{{
// restMethod: <REST_METHOD>
// restLocation: <REST_LOCATION>
}}}

Where `<REST_METHOD>` is one of GET, PUT, POST, DELETE and `<REST_LOCATION>` is the part of URL to access to service's operation.

These comments should be added for each service operation, for which you want to include REST support.

== 2. Modifying Calculator service ==

Open !CalculatorComponent/src/Calculator.h and add these lines before Add operation
{{{
// restMethod: GET
// restLocation: Add/a={nA},b={nB}
}}}

You should get:
{{{
...

    //! Add operation
    /*! \param nA - first argument
        \param nB - second argument
        \return nA + nB result
    */
    // restMethod: GET
    // restLocation: Add/a={nA},b={nB}
    virtual int Add(int nA, int nB) = 0;

...
}}}

Regenerate service wrapper by entering codegen's command from !CalculatorComponent/src directory:
{{{
staff_codegen -tcomponent Calculator.h
}}}

Compile and install modified service.

Restart Axis2/c.

== 3. Test web service using web browser ==

Open next URL to invoke our RESTful service samples.Calculator:

http://localhost:9090/axis2/services/samples.Calculator/Add/a=1,b=2

Service execution results must shown.
