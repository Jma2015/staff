It's a little guide for compiling and installing Staff on Windows.

= Details =

== 0. Environment variables ==
While compiling, starting axis2/c or any client/service application, these environment variables, points to Axis2/С и Staff homes and system paths, must be set:
{{{
AXIS2C_HOME=c:\ws\axis2c
STAFF_HOME=c:\ws\staff
PATH=%PATH%;%AXIS2C_HOME%/bin;%AXIS2C_HOME%/lib;%STAFF_HOME%/bin;%STAFF_HOME%/lib
}}}

You can set these variables in system properties.
After setting these variables, You must relogin or reboot windows.

== 1. Compile and install dependencies ==

You need axis2/c-1.5.0 to be installed. Please, refer to http://ws.apache.org/axis2/c/download.cgi.

Unpack directory contents axis2c-bin-1.5.0-win32 into c:\ws\axis2c

Make sure that Axis2/С starts:
{{{
c:\ws\axis2c\bin\axis2_http_server.exe
}}}

It must be console window with text:

Started Simple Axis2 HTTP Server ...
}}}

Make sure, that Axis2/C is working, refer to:
http://localhost:9090/axis2/services/

Please refer to http://code.google.com/p/staff/source/checkout to read guide for getting source code from svn repository.
Or checkout the [http://code.google.com/p/staff/downloads/list Download] section.


== 3. Compiling source code ==

=== 3.1 Compiling and installing rise ===

The compilation is available from the command line or from the IDE:
  * To compile from the command line, start rebuild.cmd from the directory rise.
  * To compile from the IDE Visual Studio 2005, start rise.sln from the directory rise, then build the library (menu Build->Build Solution).
Copy directory contents staff\rise\deploy\win_x86 into directory c:\ws\staff\.

{{{
INFO main.cpp[49]: main: 1 + 2 = 3
INFO main.cpp[53]: main: Saved service mem: 0
INFO main.cpp[58]: main: Setting mem: 46
INFO main.cpp[60]: main: 46
INFO main.cpp[61]: main: Service mem: 46
