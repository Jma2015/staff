=== Main info ===

Staff is Web Service Framework for C++, AJAX, and J2ME that is based on Apache Axis2/C.

WSF Staff wraps Apache Axis2/C code into C++, and also provides many additional features:
  * stateful [ExampleCalculatorServiceWindows#2._Creating_service_interface Web Services implementation] in C++ with instance support;
  * [ExampleCalculatorClientWindows synchronous] and [ExampleCalculatorNonBlocking asynchronous] client implementation in C++, [ExampleCalculatorAjaxClient AJAX] and [ExampleCalculatorJ2meClient J2ME];
  * [TrafficCompression traffic compression] support in J2ME and AJAX. 
  * service-component [SoaApplicationStruct architecture implementation];
  * support for RESTful [ExampleCalculatorRestfulService web services] and [ExampleCalculatorRestfulClient clients];
  * [ExampleCreatingCppClientFromWsdl WSDL] support with xsd import/export;
  * [ExampleCalculatorJ2meClient J2ME client] support is based on ksoap;
  * [CodegenMetacomments code generator] to generate any sort of Web Services related source code (not only in C++);
  * access to relational databases via [ExampleDasDataSource DAS] (data access service). <br/>_Supported DBMS: Postgresql, MySQL, SQLite3._;
  * security support (users, groups, sessions, ACLs, etc.);

<br/>
In the Service interface:
  * STL containers supported: list, vector, map;
  * Structures may be inherited;
  * Structures can be nested;
  * Structures may have struct, typedef and template fields;
  * Typedefs is supported;
  * Namespaces are treated as component's name.



=== Security ===
Security model is based on ACL and rules access users and groups to following security object:
  * components;
  * services;
  * services operations;
  * any other objects, that service can implement.
Security DB is on the SQLite 3.

=== Code generator (codegen) ===
Code generator includes following common templates:
  * web service interface generation from WSDL;
  * WSDL generation from web service interface;
  * BPEL support: codegen supports WSDL generation compatible with BPEL;
  * web service stub generation;
  * client skeleton generation;
  * Google Protocol Buffers's proto files can be generated from web service interface;
  * web service interface can be generated from Google Protocol Buffers's proto files;
  * internal files generation (Proxies, Wrappers, etc);

_Interface is an abstract C++ class that can be used for creating web services and clients;_

Most of new templates can be created without changing codegen's source code.
