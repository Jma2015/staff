#summary Example: How to modify Calculator client to enable REST

Use Calculator client from ExampleCalculatorClient.

Also, service must be modified to enable REST: ExampleCalculatorRestfulService.

== 1. Enabling REST support in client ==
To enable REST support for client you need to write three special codegen metacomments:

{{{
// *restEnable: <REST_ENABLE>
// *restMethod: <REST_METHOD>
// *wsaTo: <REST_SERVICE_LOCATION>
}}}

Where:
  * `<REST_ENABLE>` is a flag to enable or disable using of REST to call given operation;
  * `<REST_METHOD>` is either of GET, PUT, POST, DELETE as declared in the service;
  * `<REST_SERVICE_LOCATION>` is URL to access service operation.

== 2. Modifying Calculator client ==
Open Calculator/client/src/Calculator.h and add these lines before Add operation:
{{{
// *restEnable: true
// *restMethod: GET
// *restLocation: Add/a={a},b={b}
}}}

Clean and compile client.

== 3. Starting client ==

Start client as in ExampleCalculatorClient. You should get similar results.
